# Rectangle
Rectangle.java is a basic implementation of a rectangle represented by its 
width and length.

### How to build and test (from Terminal):

1. Make sure that you have the following Python testing tools installed: unittest, coverage.

2. Use `python -m pydoc rectangle` to generate the pydoc for the Rectangle class.

3. Use `python rectangle_main.py` to run the main method of the Rectangle class.

4. Use `python rectangle_tests.py` to run all unit tests in the RectangleTests class.

5. Use `coverage run --branch -m unittest rectangle_tests.py` to compute the test coverage.

6. Use `coverage html` to generate a test coverage report (in HTML). In the htmlcov folder, open the `index.html` file.
